# SUTD_DTI___Movable Shelter
A school project done in a group of 5 aimed to create something that incorporates lights at Changi Business Park.
For the project, we designed a moving shelter that closes when it rains. The shelters feature designs made with transparent materials, allowing patterns to be visible when light shines through.
